what it is like to write software for a small business which mainly builds
custom tailored solutions. As someone who worked at such places for almost six
years now let me tell you about something that happens regularly in those
companies: One peaceful day your boss will kick in your (virtual) door (the
covids is still running at the time of writing) and proclaim &quot;I&#x27;ve got a new
customer that needs a piece of software, like, YESTERDAY!&quot;. You, a veteran of
~~a thousand psychic wars~~ many commercial projects, will not even bat an eye.</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn&#x27;t sound too bad&quot;, you&#x27;ll tell your boss (hint: it never does when a
CEX briefs you) when he is done filling you in. &quot;That&#x27;s great&quot;, he will say &quot;You
should be done in two weeks, right? Oh, and by the way, the customer only uses
Azure, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Azure&quot; I sigh as my gaze wanders from my open ZSH shell to my AWS documentation
printouts to the Tux that is standing guard over my workplace as I slowly slide
down my chair, safely out of line of sight of my webcam.</p>
<p>Microsoft. The arch-nemesis.</p>
<p>But if the customer demands it, there is usually no room to negotiate as a
developer. Thus, it must be done.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-the-frontline">Drawing The Frontline</h2>
<p>What will follow is a &quot;first impression&quot;, if you want to call it that way. This
is by no means an objective, but rather a highly opinionated view of someone who
worked quite a bit with AWS and suddenly had to get up to speed with Microsofts
big blue platform fast.</p>
<p>So, lets start with my (slim) requirements: I&#x27;ll only need a way to serve a
public API, run some code in the cloud and an SQL Database to store a rather
small amount of (user generated) data. No IoT Device management or BI
functionality fizzbuzz. Preferably completely serverless, as we didn&#x27;t know how
many users would end up using the service after its release, and we wanted to be
prepared for rapid growth. In an AWS world these services would be called &quot;API
Gateway&quot;, &quot;Lambda&quot; and &quot;Serverless Aurora&quot;. Ironically, azure maintains
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services">a page</a>
where you can look up the AWS equivalent of all their services.</p>
<h2 id="off-to-enterprise-wonderland">Off To Enterprise Wonderland</h2>
<p>My biggest fear when starting out was that I would need to dust off my old,
once-booted windows installation that was rotting on my company laptop as I
expected MS to distribute their development tooling only for Windows. This fear
at least seemed to be unfounded, as their CLI is available (even packaged) for a
lot of
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt">distributions</a>.
Hell, it is even available on <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli">GitHub</a> and
thus as a
<a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&amp;show=azure-cli&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=azure">nixpkgs package</a>.</p>
<p>Then next step was to find a way to run serverless code. Azure suggests their
&quot;Functions&quot; as a Lambda replacement, so I went with this service. And I have to
admit that it is a pretty good replacement. This initial impression was mostly
shaped by the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=linux%2Ccsharp%2Cbash">Azure Functions Core Tools</a>,
a tool which allows you to run your function code locally with the same engine
and routing used in the cloud. If you have ever tried to get some code running
in a AWS Lambda you may know that most of the time you&#x27;ll have to log the input
into your function, upload a new version, run the code in a lambda, wait for
cloudwatch to update the logs, check the uglified output just to know how some
input parameters from the orchestration engine are formatted. Granted, if you
are using <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli">SAM</a> templates to deploy your
infrastructure, you can simulate
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-start-api.html">API Gateways</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-start-lambda.html">Lambdas</a>,
but this feature is <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/896">far</a>
<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/137">from</a>
<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/3041#issuecomment-817384568">perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continued to be pleasantly surprised by Functions. Not necessarily
because it had a million additional killer features, but because it continued to
be well documented and well-structured. The graphical interface Azure provides
for Functions on their website is extensive and has a lot of sub-views, but they
are always ordered and named in the same way across all their services. This may
not seem like a big deal, but just go ahead and compare the AWS console for the
IoTCore, Lambda and EC2 services. Three completely different applications with
three completely different designs, different structures and click flows as if
the teams that work at AWS never talk to eachother. Knowledge you may have
acquired for one module, e.g. about how to limit access from the public internet
to your resource, is useless in another. In Azure, in all relevant services
there is a &quot;Networking&quot; view, in which you manage the networking.</p>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" width="264" height="727" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/azure-sidebar.fe51b28e.png"/>
<p>So all is well and Azure is the greatest piece of services ever bestowed upon
humanity? Sadly, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s still Microsoft we are talking about, remember?</p>
<p>First, there are the nearly comical little things that sometimes go wrong. Like
the permission management that sometimes needs a solid 4 hours to apply changes
(and seems to be stuck on &quot;registering...&quot; in the meantime) or the time it takes
to provision a &quot;&quot;&quot;serverless&quot;&quot;&quot; Database.</p>
<p>Speaking about Databases, we haven&#x27;t talked about my SQL experience yet, have
we? As I said in the beginning, I wanted to use as many serverless services as
possible. This was especially important for me for the database as a) database
instances are EXPENSIVE and I don&#x27;t like them idling around when the traffic is
low during the initial phases of a project, b) scaling them afterwards is a pain
in the you-know-what, and c) I always struggle to predict how much load ends up
on the database when all services are up and running. Having a serverless db
solves all these problems for me and I have used them extensively on AWS, so I
went to look for the Azure replacement. But where AWS offers you two open source
flavours (Postgres and MySql compatible), Microsoft offers ... Microsoft SQL
Server. Thats it. You can get a static instance for Postgres and MySQL no
problem, but not in a serverless environment. If I ever feel the need to migrate
to a fixed instance for cost reasons, I&#x27;ll have to stick with MSSQL (which is,
by the way, extremely expensive compared to a fixed postgres instance: At the
time of writing, a Gen5 4CPU, 20GB Postgres instance goes for 0.352€/hour, while
a Gen5 4CPU 20.4GB MSSQL instances will set you back 0.91€/hour).</p>
<p>This was the first time
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">EEE</a> came back
into my mind. Shortly thereafter, I stumbled over &quot;stages&quot; for Azure Functions.
This is, again, a really thoughtful addition to the service which allows you to
deploy your Function code directly into multiple deployment slots like &quot;dev&quot;,
&quot;staging&quot; and &quot;production&quot;. The code in these instances can also be switched at
will, f.e. you can test you changes and staging and swap this instance over to
the production slot with the additional benefit that your application is already
&quot;hot&quot;, caches prewarmed etc. A great feature, right? Though luck, you cannot use
it if you run your Function code in a serverless Linux environment. You can do
so when running in a Windows environment, even when running on a fixed Linux
instance, but
<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/96db82b7a60a7399b3d470b744eae66c7bea4dbc/articles/azure-functions/functions-deployment-slots.md#support-levels">not on Linux serverless</a>
(or &quot;consumption&quot;, as they call it).</p>
<img alt="" loading="lazy" width="690" height="240" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/azure-no-consumption-stages.3cfa9bf1.png"/>
<p>Why is that, when the technology is in place for windows, and linux, even
serverless environments? Just to make it slightly more inconvenient to use a
linux environment for your function. Just as it slightly more inconvenient to
use an open source database. Sure, you can use all their development tooling on
a linux machine without a hassle, it even is open source for the most part, but
in the cloud, where the money is and your business thrives or dies, you can feel
the enterprise creep.</p>
<h2 id="would-i-recommend-it">Would I recommend it?</h2>
<p>So, taking into account all of these things, good and bad, would I recommend
Azure? Would I, personally, with my current knowledge, prefer it over AWS?</p>
<p>The thing is: I&#x27;d love to hate it. I really do. But Azure continues to <em>feel</em>
like the better platform from a UX perspective. It&#x27;s obvious that someone paid
close attention to all the annoying things on AWS and set out to fix them.</p>
<p>To get back to the question of recommending Azure. I think it basically comes
down to whether you think that you can stop Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary software
from seeping too deep into your stack. Because yes, using a cloud platform in
any form always comes with some degree of vendor lock-in, but when the
foundation of it is free and open software, you are always able to migrate to
another platform or host some services yourself if you like. Sure, this will
require a lot of work, but if your business model depends on it, or the need for
it is big enough, e.g. when prices increase, terms of services change, or the
service you use just develops into a direction which makes it unsustainable to
use it further, the possibility exists. Image that Azure stops supporting Linux
one day because they think they can take back the server market? Or decide that
they can increase licence cost for MSSQL tenfold?</p></div></article><section class="w-full py-12 md:py-24 lg:py-32 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="container px-4 md:px-6 mx-auto"><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tighter sm:text-5xl text-center mb-4 md:mb-6">More posts like this one</h2><div class="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"><div class="rounded-xl border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow flex flex-col justify-between"><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6"><h3 class="font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight"><a href="/posts/nodejs-native-ts-benchmark/">A look at native TypeScript performance</a></h3><div class="flex items-center space-x-1 text-sm text-gray-500"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-calendar h-4 w-4"><path d="M8 2v4"></path><path d="M16 2v4"></path><rect width="18" height="18" x="3" y="4" rx="2"></rect><path d="M3 10h18"></path></svg><time dateTime="2025-02-24T14:32:53.120Z">Feb 24, 2025, 3:32 PM</time></div></div><div class="p-6 pt-0"><p>Node.js 23.6.0 dropped the experimental flag for native TypeScript support.

But where AWS offers you two open source\nflavours (Postgres and MySql compatible), Microsoft offers ... Microsoft SQL\nServer. Thats it. You can get a static instance for Postgres and MySQL no\nproblem, but not in a serverless environment.
