17:T4e5,Speaking about Databases, we haven't talked about my SQL experience yet, have
we? As I said in the beginning, I wanted to use as many serverless services as
possible. This was especially important for me for the database as a) database
instances are EXPENSIVE and I don't like them idling around when the traffic is
low during the initial phases of a project, b) scaling them afterwards is a pain
in the you-know-what, and c) I always struggle to predict how much load ends up
on the database when all services are up and running. Having a serverless db
solves all these problems for me and I have used them extensively on AWS, so I
went to look for the Azure replacement. But where AWS offers you two open source
flavours (Postgres and MySql compatible), Microsoft offers ... Microsoft SQL
Server. Thats it. You can get a static instance for Postgres and MySQL no
problem, but not in a serverless environment. If I ever feel the need to migrate
to a fixed instance for cost reasons, I'll have to stick with MSSQL (which is,
by the way, extremely expensive compared to a fixed postgres instance: At the
time of writing, a Gen5 4CPU, 20GB Postgres instance goes for 0.352â¬/hour, while
a Gen5 4CPU 20.4GB MSSQL instances will set you back 0.91â¬/hour).14:[["$","p",null,{"children":"If you have worked in a big company for your whole working life, you may not now\nwhat it is like to write software for a small business which mainly builds\ncustom tailored solutions.
