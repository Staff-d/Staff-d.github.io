17:T4e5,Speaking about Databases, we haven't talked about my SQL experience
yet, have we? As I said in the beginning, I wanted to use as many
serverless services as possible. This was especially important for me for the
database as a) database instances are EXPENSIVE and I don't like
them idling around when the traffic is low during the initial phases
of a project, b) scaling them afterwards is a pain in the you-know-what, and c)
I always struggle to predict how much load ends up on the database
when all services are up and running. Having a serverless db solves
all these problems for me and I have used them extensively on AWS,
so I went to look for the Azure replacement. But where AWS offers
you two open source flavours (Postgres and MySql compatible),
Microsoft offers ... Microsoft SQL Server. Thats it. You can
get a static instance for Postgres and MySQL no problem, but
not in a serverless environment. If I ever feel the need to
migrate to a fixed instance for cost reasons, I'll have to
stick with MSSQL (which is, by the way, extremely expensive
compared to a fixed postgres instance: At the time of writing,
a Gen5 4CPU, 20GB Postgres instance goes for 0.352€/hour, while a
Gen5 4CPU 20.4GB MSSQL instances will set you back 0.91€/hour).14:[["$","p",null,{"children":"If you have worked in a big company for your whole working life,\nyou may not now what it is like to write software for a small\nbusiness which mainly builds custom tailored solutions.
